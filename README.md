## hma_kinesics - HEAD MOTION ANALYSIS USING KINESICS

![Block diagram of the code.](/assets/images/system-diagram.png)

This repository contains the code for generating kinemes and kineme histograms described in the ICMI 2024 paper titled "Detecting Autism from Head Movements using Kinesics'.
The code reads head movements angles yaw, pitch, and roll and generates kinemes and kineme histograms. The head movements angle sequences pitch' yaw and roll are generated by fitting  3D Morphable Model to face images in each frame of the input video.  This can be done by using 3DI [(https://github.com/sariyanidi/3DI)] OpenFace [models](https://github.com/TadasBaltrusaitis/OpenFace)], and this step is not included in the code here.

### Introduction 


### Background and Development
The codes in this repo are mostly developed by Muhittin Gokmen during his sabbatical leave from MEF University, Turkey, at the Center for Autism Research (CAR) of Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), USA from September 2023 to September 2024.
